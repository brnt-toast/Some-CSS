# Some CSS
 just a little bit of CSS goes a long way

## Notes about this project
* PURE sass/css -- something that is static by nature. If someone is blocking JS in the browser i AT LEAST want my layout to work...
* responsive doesn't matter -- those specific styles should be written for each project. However, don't write the same rules over and over (...and over and over and over and over..) to make a picture round or a button with a border
* DO NOT USE JAVASCRIPT -- CSS/SASS isn't scary. everyone should learn it...
